\subsection{Conceptual Framework}
The diagram below which contains the inputs,processes and outputs is the conceptual framework.
The user registers to the system using his/her name,email,phone number and business types. This
data is validated and is stored in the database if it does not exist. The system then prompts the user to login
using the created account.If the details the user enters don't exist in the database,the user is redirected to
the register page.  If the user logs in and the details exist,the system checks the user type(is the user a merchant or farmer).
If the user is a merchant,he/she is prompted to fill in business details for example business name,its registration details and his/her payment account.
Once the details have been saved to the database,the Merchant can now check auction products and order any of them.
If the user is a farmer,he/she is requested to fill in the product type intended to be auctioned and his/her payment account. Once saved to 
the database,the farmer can view order listings and auction products
