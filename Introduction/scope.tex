\subsection{Scope}
The scope of the proposal is to come up with a project that enables farmers market their produce online and expect customers within a defined time period. The project
will also enable merchants buy farm produce from farmers at agreed prices. The project is intended to serve the Kenya population in all counties
but with high priority in urbanized areas and agricultural counties in Kenya.
