\subsection{Justification}
The system will enable farmers find potential customers much easily and faster hence creating a consistent market of their produce
and solve farm produce wastage that occur due to many issues one of them being lack of market.
The system will also create  a consistent supply of farm produce to merchants,hence feeding the high demand
of farm produce in Kenya. Because the system will be a B2B ecommerce system,time will be saved as everthing will operate virtually.
According to the international fund of agricultural development,80\% of  the rural
population of Kenya rely on the agriculture sector as their primary source of employment.
This means that more than 20 million Kenyans are small/medium scale farmers\cite{r7}. This shows that in the business perspective,the system may attact high
number of potential customers and solve the problems that they may be facing.
