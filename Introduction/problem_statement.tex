\subsection{Problem statement}
Marketing of Agricultural goods(especially perishable goods) has always been a challenge. Research suggest that farmers
in Kenya loose about 95 million litres of milk each year accounting to US\$22.5 million dollars. Developed countries loose
even more money with United states loosing US\$48.3  billion,Australia loosing US\$10.5 billion and China loosing 50 million tonnes of grain which would
account for billions of dollars\cite{r6}.
In total the world looses about US\$1 trillion. Although  wastage of agricultural products can be attributed to diffrent challanges,lack of market is a major cause.
Farmers should not struggle finding market for their produce,soo do merchants finding supply.There are cases where farmers plant
alot of plants,use their resources to take care of the crops but end up feeding the produce to their livestock because there is no market. Merchant on the other hand buy farm
produce from middlemen who exploit them by doubling the price of farm produce.
