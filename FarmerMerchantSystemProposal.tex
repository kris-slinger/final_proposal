\begin{abstract}
    Technological advancements of the internet have lead to creation of millions of ecommerse systems that have facilitated
    easier selling of goods and services just by a click of a button. Unfortunately,it has not been  absorbed well in the farming
    sector due to bias opinion's that \emph{farming is not profitable}. This has discouraged investors focus on farming due to this prejudice causing farmers
    to suffer economically and be exploited by middlemen. With the economic opportunity farming offers,it makes sense to develop a platform that connects merchants and farmers directly to enable
    a consistent market of goods produced by the farmer. The following project discusses on a proposed  mobile merchant-farmer auction system that utilizes ecommerse technologies for example
    \emph{price tooling,shipping and tracking information,smart search and payment integration systems} with a core aim to facilitate easier ecommerse services on the farming sector.
